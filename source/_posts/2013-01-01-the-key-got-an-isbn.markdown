My first story finally got an ISBN. For those of you who don't know what an ISBN is,<a title="Everything You Need to Know About ISBNs" href="http://allisonbetancourt.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-isbns/"> check it out here</a>. The gist is, now it can be available in numerous stores! Yay! Also it is so much easier to Google search my book now.

Here are some stores where it is available:

Kobo: <a href="http://www.kobobooks.com/ebook/The-Key/book-IrV5-O5GBkSKZdHo6rOeXQ/page1.html">http://www.kobobooks.com/ebook/The-Key/book-IrV5-O5GBkSKZdHo6rOeXQ/page1.html</a>

Smashwords: <a href="https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/308064">https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/308064</a>

In other news, my next story is getting wrapped up. It is so far twice the length of "The Key" and it looks like it'll be longer than that. The working title is called "Dreamwalkers" and is about a teen who can walk through people's dreams. More details to come later!
