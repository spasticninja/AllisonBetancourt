There are only seven original plots out there, so let’s be honest, my work and your work aren’t that original. That shouldn’t stop us from writing and doing our best to think outside the box.

##5 cliche plot devices and how to avoid them##

<!--more-->

**1)  The love triangle.**

This one occurs a lot in young adult and romance novels. It’s become so common in TV dramas too and some even consider it mandatory, but it isn’t. It’s now become an overused plot device, especially if this is the source of the drama.

And that’s how you avoid the cliche. Don’t use the love triangle as a main source of drama. Maybe even at a twist like a double triangle (four way love triangle or a member of the triangle is part of two triangles) or maybe play with the sexuality of the characters (do all the characters have to be straight?).

**2)  *The chosen one*.**

This plot device is used a lot in epics. The main character is “the chosen one” or “the prophesied one” and they alone can save the world. This has certainly become an overused plot device.

You can still use the chosen one, but I recommend explaining very well why they are the chosen one. Or maybe they are one of many chosen one (like the slayer in Buffy). You can also try to avoid this cliche and make the character in the wrong place at the wrong time, or just, simply, convinced that they should take on the quest (like Frodo in LOTR).

**3) It was all a dream/It was all in their head.**

This plot device allows the writer(s) to wipe every crazy thing that just happened away. This cliche is overused and also can get the reader angry.

Try to avoid this cliche. It’s very hard to successfully pull off. If you decide to go bold, try to throw in hints that the person is dreaming (like how Amy in Doctor Who would see her captor). It’s better if this plot device is not a surprise, otherwise it will seem that this was a cheap, last minute twist to the story.

**4) The bomb/doomsday device gets deactivated with only seconds to spear.**

This plot device is most commonly found in action stories. The bomb or doomsday device is helpful in that it provides pacing for the story, but so many stories use the drama of the clock almost hitting zero, but not quite.

Maybe the character’s don’t disarm the bomb? Try and avoid this cliche by putting a twist on it. What if the bomb part was disconnected? What if it does go off and this instead becomes a story of revenge or redemption?

**5)  The throw-out character is too helpful.**

I’ve seen this a few times in stories, it can happen when authors write in sequence and need a character to help move the plot along. These characters are only introduced to help the main characters find that vital clue or save them from doom.

The easiest way to avoid this cliche is to not have the throw away character at all or make the character a minor character. The reason this cliche is just that is, it seems out of place to have a sudden character pop out of nowhere to save the main character.
