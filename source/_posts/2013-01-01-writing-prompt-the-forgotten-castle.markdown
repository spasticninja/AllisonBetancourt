This week's writing prompt is an original of mine. One thing you'll learn about me is how much I like looking at photos of abandoned places. Why were these places abandoned? Who has walked through the halls? That is where I got the idea for this week's writing prompt.

<strong>The Forgotten Castle</strong>

Imagine you get lost in a thick, dense forest in Europe. When you finally walk out of the forest, you see a large abandoned castle. As a rain storm approaches, you decide to check it out. Write an adventure where this castle is the setting.
