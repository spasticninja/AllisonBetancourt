In the past, I’ve discussed the grammar of quotation marks and dialogue. Now I’m going to discuss semicolons and colons.

Here is a song from Lonely Island about the *miss-*use of semicolons. **Please note: there is some foul language in the video, but it’s awesome nonetheless.**

##Colons ( : )##

As writers, we use colons pretty frequently and we often see or use them in titles and lists.

Here are some common uses for the colon:

1. Colons are often used to list items following a sentence. The sentence part is key. Colons are not supposed to precede a list if there is no sentence. However, there are some styles of publication that can allow this.

- EX: I need you to get the following items from the grocery store: eggs, milk, butter.
- EX: There are three things a writer must do to get published:
-- (a) write clearly and well.
-- (b) edit their work.
-- (c) get people to read and submit feedback.

Note: In the second example above, the different points do not necessarily need punctuation. If the points are single words or phrases you can leave the punctuation out. Also the letters could be numbers and can follow any chosen numbering style.

2. Use a colon between two sentences when the second sentence explains the first sentence. If only one sentence follows the colon, don’t capitalize the start of the sentence. If two sentences follow the colon, capitalize the both sentences.

- EX: I enjoy reading: novels by Terry Pratchett are my favorite.
- EX: Cumin is used in Indian Food: It provides a great flavor. It also colors the dish with a nice yellow color.
3. Use a colon to introduce a passage or a quote that is more than three lines in length.

- EX: The Author of Touched, Jane Straus, wrote in the first chapter:
{%blockquote%}
Georgia went back to her bed and stared at the intricate patterns of burned moth wings in the translucent glass of the overhead light. Her father was in “hyper mode” again where nothing could calm him down.

He’d been talking nonstop for a week about remodeling projects, following her around the house as she tried to escape his chatter. He was just about to crash, she knew.
{%endblockquote%}
4. Use a colon to follow the salutation of a buisness letter, even if it is just a name.

- EX: Dr. Rodrigez: [rest of letter]

##Semicolons ( ; )##

Many writers are afraid to use semicolons. It seems like there are complex rules for the use of semicolons, but there isn’t. Semicolons often add a little variety to sentences when used sparingly.

Here is how to use a semicolon:

1. Semicolons connect two similar thoughts even if they could be two separate sentences.

- EX: That book was great; I’d love to borrow it again.
- EX: Some writers write on a computer; others prefer to use paper and pen.

Note:  In each example above, there could be two separate sentences, but because the two clauses are related, they can be joined with a semicolon. A good rule of thumb for this usage of semicolon is: a comma allows for a short pause, a semicolon allows for a longer pause, and a period completely stops the thought.

2. Semicolons can link two clauses that are connected by transitional phrases or conjunctive adverbs.

- EX: However you choose to write, people make their own decisions; as a result, there are many ways to write and each is important in their own way.

Note: Conjunctive adverbs are words such as: however, therefore, indeed, etc. Examples of Transitional phrases include: “for example”, “as in”, “as a result”, etc.

3. Semicolons can be used in lists when commas are used within a listed section. They can help differentiate between different items when the items are long in description.

- EX: There are two basic ways to write: with pen and paper, which is easily portable and inexpensive; or with a computer, which can be expensive when you consider printing costs.

4. Semicolons also link lengthy clauses or clauses with commas in them. This is similar to 1. just with longer clauses.

- EX: Some writers choose to write with pen and paper; but others, choose to use different methods such as computers and typewriters.

There is a great comic from <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/semicolon" target="_blank">The Oatmeal</a> describing semicolons.
