Are you writing multiple stories at once? Then join the club. I am currently in the middle of four stories right now and I'm weighing my options on whether this is a good thing or a bad thing. On researching the topics, I see that I'm not the only one

Here are some pros and cons. Feel free to add your own if you think of anything else.

<strong>Pros to writing multiple stories:</strong>
<ul>
	<li><span style="line-height: 13px;"><strong>Time to work think, while still practicing and improving your writing.</strong> For me the theory goes, like when taking a test in school and you get stuck on a problem, you should move on. Later you may think of the solution through working on other solutions. You just have to remember to go back.</span></li>
	<li><strong>Switching work on occasion allows you to revitalize you enthusiasm for your work</strong>. By tag-teaming projects, you can work on one project till you get bored and then work on another. Leap frogging allows you to continue writing and improving while you work through your thinking and your boredom.</li>
	<li><strong>You can finish multiple stories at once!</strong> If you leapfrog through multiple stories, you are likely to finish multiple stories around the same time. You could also offset some of your work so while you finish one, you are near the middle of another and you won't be far from finishing another story.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Cons to writing multiple stories:</strong>
<ul>
	<li><span style="line-height: 13px;"><strong>You can get distracted from actually finishing a story.</strong> Many people have a problem with actually finishing a piece. It's often easier to start a new project than to complete an older one. To prevent this, you can limit yourself to a certain number of stories and you can't start another until you've finished one. </span></li>
	<li><span><span style="line-height: 13px;"><strong>You can forget which story is which.</strong> If you are writing multiple stories in the same universe, you could forget what each character needs to do or which story line is which. If this happens to you, writing an outline may be a good solution. </span></span></li>
	<li><strong>It is possible to get stuck on four stories at once.</strong> You can still run out of ideas or inspiration even when you ware working on four different stories. Sometimes you can hit a dry spell of inspiration. It is often quicker to at least finish one story when you start to find your inspiration again.</li>
</ul>
Those are my pros and cons. Let me know what other pros and cons you may come across with your Writing ADD.
