I have been really bad about posting these past few weeks and it’s because I’m writing a technical manual. I have been trying to get some technical writing freelance jobs for a while now and now, but now that I’m going through the process, I’m learning about what is actually involved in becoming a freelance technical writer.

My background is in Electrical Engineering and Writing. I wanted to merge the two with technical writing. I clearly don’t have any issues with understanding technical concepts – five years learning to be an electrical engineer has at least taught me that. The issue is that writing technical documents is completely different from writing fiction. Here is how:

**1) Language.**

Technical writing is usually written in a more “dry” language. Things like metaphors and similes have no place because being clear and concise are what’s important. Furthermore you don’t need to have dry writing in a technical document.

**2) Audience.**

Keeping audience in mind is important in any writing, but when writing manuals, you have to write for everyone.

**3) Clients.**

Clients need to be kept up to date on your progress and since they are paying you, their work needs to come first.
