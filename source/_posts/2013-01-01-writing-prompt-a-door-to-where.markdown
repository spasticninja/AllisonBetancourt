I haven't done a writing prompt in a while, but I figure now's as good a time as any.

##A Door to Where?##

###Imagine###
Imagine you are exploring an old city and you wonder into a forgotten little corner. You see an old door that creaks open as you approach. On the other side of the door is a place you cannot even imagine. Write about the world on the other side of the door. You don't even have to be the subject, just write about the world.
