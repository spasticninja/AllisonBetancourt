This is where you get to tell the world about yourself! Author bios are great for publishers and for indie-authors alike. Having an author bio will inform readers about who you are and give you a professional look. That being said, most of the successful bios are short and sweet.

Here are some tips for writing your author biography.<a href="http://allisonbetancourt.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Old-Books-2.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-204" alt="Old Books 2" src="http://allisonbetancourt.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Old-Books-2-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a>
<ul>
	<li><strong>First read at least ten author bios from best selling/favorite authors.</strong> This will help you get a great idea what to look for in your author bio.</li>
	<li><strong>Brainstorm</strong> with a list before you write the bio. This is a common tactic. Just write a bunch of things about yourself in a list. Circle or mark the most important just include the ones most relevant.</li>
	<li><span style="line-height: 13px;"><strong>Write in third person</strong> when writing a bio for a proposal or for a book jacket. Write in first person for queries. </span></li>
	<li><strong>Make it professional</strong>, but also be sure not to make the bio too stiff. Add some personality.</li>
	<li><strong>Be concise.</strong> We don't need to know of every scrape and bump you've received since childhood. It is usually a good idea to just include information about your life now as a writer. Just hit the highlights of your life. Try and be short, but sweet.</li>
	<li><strong>Add some credibility</strong>. If you've sold 100,000 copies, say it. If you don't have a big sell to boast about, tell the reader about writing organizations you are a member of or how many pieces you've published.</li>
	<li><strong>Re-read your bio and critique it!</strong> Make sure there are no grammar or spelling mistakes. You want to make sure your bio is prefect and ready to go. Also try reading it aloud to make sure the pacing and word choice is to your liking.</li>
</ul>
Make sure you take your time with your bio. It is important that you create something that is short, but sweet and that you like it. That's it for now. Keep writing!
