Practice makes perfect. Lots and lots of practice. This certainly holds true for writing too. Writers need to constantly work on scenes or short stories to practice their writing. We only improve with experience. That's where writing prompts come in. Writing prompts are designed to inspire the imagination and provide practice.

My goal is to provide a writing prompt with the goal of providing a new prompt once a week. I will of course participate in a few and post mine in the comments and on <a title="ABBetancourt on deviantArt" href="http://abbetancourt.deviantart.com/">deviantArt</a> when I do. The prompts are usually ones I will find in my travels of the internet, but occasionally they will be my own. I will note each prompt either way. The writing prompts will tend to be fantasy or science fiction in nature, but you don't have to stick to those genres when you write. Those genres are just my preference.

Without further ado, here is the first writing prompt:

<blockquote>"If we could experience our favorite or most distressing emotions and memories by drinking a potion, what would the consequences be? Would we lose ourselves in a fog of our past? Or would this ability prove comforting and even useful? Would you want to live someone else's emotional memories? Tell us your tale of these memory potions."</blockquote>
