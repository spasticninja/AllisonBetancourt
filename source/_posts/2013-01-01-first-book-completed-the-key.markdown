Hello, everyone!

My very first short story has been finished and uploaded to <a title="The Key" href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Key-ebook/dp/B00AZ0Z4GA">Amazon</a>. Now I'm just waiting approval. The book is about 10,000 words in length and tells the story of James Rook and Amber Collins.

Amber Collins is a girl on the run. She posses a magical key that creates a portal between two doors. Unlocking one door can open another door on the other side of the world. Amber runs into an old school friend, James Rook, who gets attacked by an assassin hunting Amber and the magic key. The assassin is part of an organization know as the Dark Men, who collect curious trinkets like the key to gain supernatural powers. After subduing the assassin, Amber and James decide the only course of action to be free from the assassins is to destroy the key.

The book will be released soon on Amazon only for the time being. It will only cost $0.99.
