I’ve taken an impromptu break from writing my blog as I have been focusing on freelancing and work, because money. I like money. It allows me to buy things like food and gas. That doesn’t mean I haven’t been at least brainstorming, I just have been to tired to write.

#7 Tips for Getting Inspired#

<!--more-->

**1.  Don’t spend too long on one section**

The want to have what we write be perfect can sometimes hinder our progress. I know this is particularly true for me. Sometimes it helps to skip around so you can keep developing your world or characters.

**2. Make some time for yourself and your imagination**

Schedule time for yourself. This can help relax you (great during times of stress) and help you think about your story. Brainstorming often inspires me to actually get my notepad out and write.

**3. Schedule “creative time” with friends and/or family**

Scheduling time for writing is helpful. Hitting the library or local coffee shop often provides a great environment for writing. There distractions are limited and scheduling time with friends makes you forced to keep the appointment.

**4. Write a detailed outline**

I write so many outlines. Usually the hard part is turning the outline into the story and sometimes, keeping to the outline. Making the outline more detailed can help make the outline part of the story, allowing you to dissect what’s really going on in the scene.

**5. Keep a journal by your bed and in your bag/purse**

Keeping something nearby to write on will help you remember when you have that random euphoria or bought of inspiration. The best times for inspiration is often in the shower or as you wake up, but inspiration can happen anywhere.

**6. Keep your notes in the cloud**

This can be similar to number 4, allowing you to take the journal idea with you everywhere thanks to your cellphone. Using Google Docs or Dropbox with your favorite document editor can allow you to read and edit anywhere.

**7. Switch up how you write**

Used to writing on the computer, write a notepad for a while. Used to handwriting, switch to the computer (although, you may want to turn the wifi off). I’m starting to associate my laptop with work, It’s making me not want to write and can distract me. So, I’ve taken to writing on my cellphone or on a notepad. Eventually I will get tired of the notepad and will switch again. As long as I keep writing, it doesn’t matter.

Keep trying to be inspired and keep writing!
