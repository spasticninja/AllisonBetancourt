##I made this website awesome and so can you!##

If you've been here before, you may have noticed that I used to write about writing. I still write. I still participate in NaNoWriMo (yay!!). But now,
I make websites too. I never thought I would be programming, but now I am. I've been messing around with <a href="http://getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">Twitter Bootstrap</a> and now <a href="http://octopress.org" target="_blank">Octopress</a>, I have found that it's quite rewarding to build websites. As such, I am changing my website to reflect the work I'm currently into. I still like to write - and I'll keep writing blog posts about Writing - but now I'll also be writing blog posts on Web Development.
