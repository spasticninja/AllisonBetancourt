In one of my many procrastinating moments, I discovered this video:

And it really got me thinking. Maybe, sometimes, my inability to focus isnâ€™t just a bad thing. I have though of many plot points randomly driving in the car, while brushing my teeth, etc. I routinely use the time between being awake and being asleep as creative space for a book. Now I just need to write them down.

Do you have a wandering mind? What do you do to get into the creative mode?
