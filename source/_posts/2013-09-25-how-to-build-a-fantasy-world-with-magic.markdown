Not every fantasy novel has to have magic to be fantasy, but a majority of fantasy stories have some form of magic involved. Magic, when used properly, can be a great device for making the impossible possible.

###The Rules to Magic###

Each fantasy story that involves magic has a system. The system contains a set a rules that are the driving or defining force to how that world works. It’s important to know that the magic that heals can’t heal death or if it can, what’s the cost.

**1. Know the Source**

Magic has to have a source, whether it’s in the core of the universe or a god. Magic stems from something. Even if you don’t reveal it in the text, it’s important for the writer to know the source.

**2. How is Magic used?**

Magic can be used in a variety of ways. It’s important to define how your characters use this magic. Are there spells? Is it instinctively done?

**3. Who can use Magic?**

Similar to the above, it’s important to know who can use magic in your story. Can only an elite class learn magic? Can everyone use it? Is it tied to a religious order?

**4. Know the Cost of Magic**

Magic usually has a cost. It makes the story more interesting and prevents magic from being too overpowered or impossibly strong. You can see this a lot in video games. Each spell has a cost, but it’s up to you to decide how much. Can a character only cast a couple spells and be done? Can they store magic in items to help? Knowing this will also help the reader and you decide how strong or weak characters are.

**5. Keep Consistent**

This is the most vital part of your world. Consistency. The rules have to remain the same for everyone or, at least, the characters need to know how to work around the rules. Not being consistent creates plot holes and those are never good.
