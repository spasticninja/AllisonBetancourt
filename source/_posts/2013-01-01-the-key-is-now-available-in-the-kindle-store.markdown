Hey, everyone!

My book is finally up and searchable! That means you can actually go to Amazon and type in my book to find it. You will have better luck typing my last name in the search as well as the title. Or you can go here.

I have uploaded my <a title="A. B. Betancourt Author page" href="amazon.com/author/abbetancourt" target="_blank">author page</a> to Amazon. Hopefully that will make my work more searchable. In the mean time I need to get some photos of me for my profile.

In other news, I've been asked if my book will be available in other formats. The answer to the question is, eventually, yes. Right now I've got an exclusive agreement with Amazon. For the next 85 days or so, my book will be on Amazon only. In exchange, my book is available in <a title="Amazon Lending Library" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&amp;docId=1000739811" target="_blank">the lending library</a>. Once the time is up, I will look into getting my book up in the Nook and Apple stores. So please be patient. In the mean time, Kindle does have a free app for your tablet, phone, and computer that you can buy books from.

Cheers and happy reading!
