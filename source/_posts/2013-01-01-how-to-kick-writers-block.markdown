We all get it at some point. We get stuck and we don't really know where or what the next step is. It's annoying and frustrating and many people stop writing completely when they get writer's block.

<strong>Why we can get writer's block</strong>

Writer's block usually happens when we get stuck either in the story or psychologically. We could decide that we were inconsistent up to a point or that our current path is flawed. We could also deside that for whatever reason, we are afraid to move on.

This is where being a perfectionist can work against you. If you want a perfect manuscript you can make yourself stuck. Whatever the reason, it's okay to get writer's block. It's working past the block that is the hard part, but it is often the most rewarding. It's important to figure out why you are blocked and work past it. That's why you're here.

<strong>How to overcome writer's block</strong>

Here are some tips on how you can overcome the pesky block. Whatever reason got you stuck you need to address it and you can try these tips to help you.
<ul>
	<li><span style="line-height: 13px;"><strong>Try writing an outline</strong>. This is a good step if you feel stuck or unsure of what should come next. Start from the beginning and see if you can find the way past your block with a shorter, more linear approach. </span></li>
	<li><strong>Keep notes.</strong> This is especially true for more complicated or longer pieces. It is a good idea to keep track of all your characters and their motivations in another document as you write. I typically like to also include basic physical descriptions so that a character with brown eyes won't suddenly have green eyes.</li>
	<li><strong>Brainstorm/free thought</strong>. This can be used in conjunction with the outline and notes easily. Just write down everything you can about your story. Write about the character's motivations, what major plot points you want to hit, etc. Doing this allows you to more easily see the big picture and add more notes that can help you connect plot points.</li>
	<li><strong>Reread what you've written</strong>. Reread all of it. Sometimes as we write we can forget what we've already written. We can forget the energy we were going for in certain scenes and we can sometimes forget some character motivations or plot points. So just go back and reread it. This is particularly true if we take a longer break between writing sessions.</li>
	<li><strong>Sleep on your brainstorm sessions/outline/notes.</strong> We are programmed to make the best decisions in the morning when we wake up. That is why sleeping on any type of decision is actually beneficial.  You can easily apply this towards your writing.</li>
	<li><strong>Know that you aren't going to have a perfect first draft</strong>. This is big. You have to be okay with the idea that you are going to write a few scenes that aren't that great. It doesn't really matter, it's a draft. Being a perfectionist is what probably got you stuck here in the first place, but you have to keep in mind that this is the reason we write multiple drafts. It's okay not to write some trash here or there, just so long as you get through it so you can work on better scenes down the road. Write now, edit later.</li>
	<li><strong>Try to piecemeal your work</strong>. Stuck because you just don't want to write that particular scene, but you know what you want to happen next? If that is the only thing slowing you down, skip it and write a later piece of your story. Do keep in mind that you may need an outline or notes so you can help connect the pieces of your work together in the end.</li>
	<li><strong>Schedule some time to write.</strong> Having writer's block is when it's most crucial to schedule time to write. Most people feel they would rather do something else than to get past whatever is blocking them. Scheduling time with little to no distractions may force you to find inspiration or even just force you to brainstorm.</li>
	<li><strong>Try reorganizing your work space.</strong> Sometimes a cluttered work space makes for a cluttered mind. Try reorganizing your space to make it neater.</li>
	<li><strong>Try going to a library or coffee shop to write.</strong> Sometimes  a change of scenery can help you focus better. Especially if you go somewhere without the internet. Sometimes the internet can be more of a distraction that a useful tool, so if you limit your access while you write, it may help you to actually, you know, write.</li>
</ul>
Whatever the reason for writer's block, it's important to identify why you have writer's block and then work on getting past it. Keep in mind that every writer gets writer's block at some point. These are just tips to help you work on being productive through your block.
