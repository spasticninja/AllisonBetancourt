Imagine that you went diving and happened upon a sunken ship. On this deck, you see a group of people in pre-French Revolution outfits having a tea party. What are those people doing there? Why are they partying on the sunken ship? In your own words, give the back story to these ghostly creatures and reply in the comments.
