Again, I found a picture of an abandoned place for this week's writing prompt. I'm addicted to looking at photos of these places. There is a lot of wonder in them for me. Why were they abandoned? Why were they build in the first place?

This station is in New York City and the track is an active one. You can apparently ride through this station on the 6 train. The station itself is in the process of becoming part of a museum so soon more people can see this beauty.

<strong>Ghost Train Express</strong>

Imagine you are standing on this platform and waiting for a train. You hear a train in the distance, but as you hear it get closer, there is nothing there. A strong breeze blows a newspaper across the platform and you glance at the date as it pauses in front of you. April 30, 1930. Looking around the platform you see the ghostly images of people waiting for the train in clothes from the 1930s. Did you just travel to the past? Are you seeing ghosts? Write about it.

Please don't hesitate to post your stories or writing prompt ideas in the comments. Keep writing!
