In the last grammar post, I talked about the different dashes – or at least the hyphen, en dash, and em dash. You may have noticed that some uses for the dash overlap with the ellipsis. Here is a brief guide that can help you learn when to use the ellipsis or the dash.

##Ellipsis ( … )##

1) Ellipsis are often used to denote a thought or sentence that is incomplete or trails off.

{% blockquote %} “Don’t go in there, it’s…” he paused to gather his thoughts, “…weird.”{% endblockquote %}

2) Use ellipsis when quotes are being shortened or when material is being omitted from the passage.

{% blockquote %} The absurdity of the situation makes me ponder Hamlet’s query “whether ‘tis nobler in the mind to suffer . . . outrageous fortune.”{% endblockquote %}

3) Use a 4-period ellipsis (also called a closed ellipsis) when ending with a partial quote.

{% blockquote %}
Original sentence: I have a weathered copy of that photograph in my own personal collection.

Partial quotation using a closed ellipsis: I have a weathered copy of that photograph . . . .
{% endblockquote %}

##Dash ( – )##

1) Dashes are often used in dialogue writing to denote that someone has been cut off.

{% blockquote %}“Don’t go in there it’s–” The door slammed in his face before he could warn them.{% endblockquote %}

2) As mentioned in the last post, dashes are used to interrupt the sentence. They can be used to start lists that have commas in them, used to illustrate, restate or summarize a sentence, or even change tone.

{% blockquote %} Three people in my group–Tom, Rodger, and Sally–refused to participate in critiques.{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote %} One person of the group will only wear blue–my mother.{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote %} Tom did not wish to participate because his feelings for Sally–he is madly in love with her–will never change.{% endblockquote %}

3) Dashes are used to set off appositives that contain commas. Appositives are noun or noun phrase that immediately follows a noun or pronoun.

{% blockquote %} Learning the mechanics–the complex, detailed structural components–of the English language is very difficult because the rules are often so inconsistent{% endblockquote %}

A Simple Rule for Writing Dialogue: Use the ellipsis for when a sentence trails off and use the dash when a sentence gets cut off.

Ellipsis and dashes add great variety to a piece, but like most grammar, needs to be used properly. Ellipsis and dashes are best used sparingly.
