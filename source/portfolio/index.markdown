Hi! Welcome to my little corner of the internet. I am an engineer turned web developer, technical writer, and published author. I guess you can call me a jack-of-all-internet-trades. Even better, I'm always eager to learn new languages and skills.

My resume and cover letter:

    <h3 class="media-heading">Love'em & Leave'em Pet Care</h3>
    <p>Maggie, owner and founder of Love'em & Leave'em, needed an updated website but didn't know where to start. I designed her website using Bootstrap and Octopress. I then helped her setup the website on the content management system, 900dpi and helped Maggie port her existing domain.</p>
    <p>Site will go live soon!<p>

    <h3 class="media-heading">Vineland Comic</h3>
    <p>Vineland Comic is a web comic about magic and alchemy. I helped write the series and built the website. Using Bootstrap (and the artist's color scheme) I implemented a comic platform, <a title="ProComic courtesy of dark12222000 on Github" href="https://github.com/dark12222000/ProComics" target="_blank">ProComic</a> to build the website. The website features social media icons, Disqus commenting, and a fast load time.</p>
